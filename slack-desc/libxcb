# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libxcb: libxcb (X protocol C-language Binding)
libxcb:
libxcb: The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol
libxcb: which is fully capable of replacing Xlib.  In fact, libX11 makes use
libxcb: of libxcb as much as possible. Porting to XCB has several advantages
libxcb: such as a smaller memory footprint, latency hiding, direct protocol
libxcb: access, and improved thread support.

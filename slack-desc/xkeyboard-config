# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

xkeyboard-config:
xkeyboard-config: The X Keyboard Extension essentially replaces the core
xkeyboard-config: protocol definition of keyboard. The extension makes possible
xkeyboard-config: to clearly and explicitly specify most aspects of keyboard
xkeyboard-config: behaviour on per-key basis and to more closely track the
xkeyboard-config: logical and physical state of the keyboard. It also includes
xkeyboard-config: a number of keyboard controls designed to make keyboards more
xkeyboard-config: accessible to people with physical impairments.

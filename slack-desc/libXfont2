# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libXfont2: libXfont2 (library for legacy X11 font system)
libXfont2:
libXfont2: libXfont2 provides the core of the legacy X11 font system, handling
libXfont2: the index files (fonts.dir, fonts.alias, fonts.scale), the various
libXfont2: font file formats, and rasterizing them. It is used by the X servers,
libXfont2: the X Font Server (xfs), and some font utilities
libXfont2: (bdftopcf for instance), but should not be used by normal X11
libXfont2: clients. X11 clients access fonts via either the new API's in
libXfont2: libXft, or the legacy API's in libX11.
